## **Pymaceuticals Inc.**

Using pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and matplotlib to analyze study data from Pymaceuticals Inc. In this study, multiple treatment regimens for squameous cell carcinoma (SCC) were administered to 249 mice, including the treatment drug of interest, Capomulin. Data was gathered over a 45 day time period, monitoring tumor growth and progression. 

The data was analyzed, providing summary statistics of the tumor volume for each drug regimen used in the study. The number of timepoints per each drug was calculated and placed in a bar graph and the number of male vs female mice used was calculated and placed in a pie chart. Final tumor volume was calculated for four specific drug regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) and quartiles, IQR, and outliers were calculated for each drug. The data across these four treatments were compared in a box plot. 

Looking specificially at mice treated with Capomulin, a line graph was created to compare tumor volume over the study period for an individual mouse. The average tumor mass was calculated for all mice treated with Capomulin and was compared to each mouse's weight in a scatterplot. Linear regression was calculated for this data, as well as the correlation coefficent. 

### **Observations based on the data analysis** 

In this study, the drug regimens Capomulin and Ramicane had the two largest numbers of timepoints, whereas the drug regimen Propriva had the fewest. The number of male and female mice in the study was very close to  being equal (50.4% vs. 49.6%).

In the group of mice treated with Capomulin, there is a strong correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume.

There is a trend for decreasing tumor volume over the study period for many of the individual mice being treated with Capomulin, but further analysis is needed to determine significance of the overall group, as well as to compare it to mice in other treatment groups.
